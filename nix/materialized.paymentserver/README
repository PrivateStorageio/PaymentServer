This directory contains "materialized" Nix expressions for packaging PaymentServer on NixOS.
Haskell.nix is capable of generating all of these expressions on the fly but at the cost of using roughly 500MB more memory.
Thus we take advantage of this "materialization" feature of Haskell.nix to make it possible to deploy this software on systems that are close to memory constrained.

The contents of this directory are automatically generated and need to be regenerated for certain kinds of dependency changes.
See <https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/tutorials/materialization/>.
