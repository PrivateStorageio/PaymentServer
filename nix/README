This directory contains expressions for packaging PaymentServer on NixOS.
The contents of this directory are almost entirely automatically generated by stack-to-nix.
Editing them is probably a bad idea since it will make future automated updates more difficult.

However, I did edit default.nix to replace the master tarball of haskell.nix with a particular revision.
Read the comment there for details.

See https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix for details of stack-to-nix.
